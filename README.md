# Asteroids

!!NOT WORKING FOR NOW!!
!! a release with the old mooselib version is available for compilation !!

An Asteroids clone using mooselib.

It will not work with the current state of mooselib.
I restructure the way a stored mooselib and removed it for a while from github. (i guess git is just not my friend)
So this is on ICE for now.
